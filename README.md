You get many visitors to your website every day, but you know only a small percentage of them are likely to buy from you, while most will perhaps not even return.Propensity modeling allows you to allocate your resources more wisely, resulting in greater efficiencies, while achieving better results. To give an example, think of this: instead of sending an email advertisement where thereâ€™s a 0%-100% chance of a user clicking it, with propensity modeling, you can target users with a 50%+ chance of clicking it. Fewer emails, more conversions! Right now you may be spending money to re-market to everyone, but perhaps we could use machine learning to identify the most valuable prospects. Having this important information can also help the marketing department know the kind of email to sent to a particular visitor.The goal is to build a web service that sends prediction that indicates if a customer has a propensity to buy based on the actions on a website.
* **Python libraries and Framework used:** Docker, gunicorn, Flask, Pandas, Pipenv, matplotlib, sklearn
* **Input:** visitor's action on the website
* **Output:** Propensity prediction
