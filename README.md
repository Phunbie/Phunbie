This project is about hosting a static website. In this project I deployed a static website to AWS 
by performing the following steps.
* Created a public S3 bucket and uploaded website files to my bucket.
* Next I configured the bucket for website hosting and secured it using IAM policies. 
* Then sped up content delivery using content distribution network service (CloudFront)
* Finally accessed my website in a browser.


# [Project 2: Cassava leaf disease classification using CNN](https://github.com/Phunbie/Caps)

In this project, I used  convolutional neural networks to train a model that can predict if a cassava  has a certain disease based on the picture of the cassava plant. I later had to use image augmentation and transfer learning to improve my accuracy.
* **Python libraries and Framework used:** Docker, Pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow
* **Machine learning Algorithms used:** Convolutional neural network,
* **Input:** Photo of the cassava plant
* **Output:** Disease prediction

You get many visitors to your website every day, but you know only a small percentage of them are likely to buy from you, while most will perhaps not even return.Propensity modeling allows you to allocate your resources more wisely, resulting in greater efficiencies, while achieving better results. To give an example, think of this: instead of sending an email advertisement where there’s a 0%-100% chance of a user clicking it, with propensity modeling, you can target users with a 50%+ chance of clicking it. Fewer emails, more conversions! Right now you may be spending money to re-market to everyone, but perhaps we could use machine learning to identify the most valuable prospects. Having this important information can also help the marketing department know the kind of email to sent to a particular visitor.The goal is to build a web service that sends prediction that indicates if a customer has a propensity to buy based on the actions on a website.
* **Python libraries and Framework used:** Docker, gunicorn, Flask, Pandas, Pipenv, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, pickle
* **Machine learning Algorithms used:** Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest, Xgboost
* **Input:** visitor's action on the website
* **Output:** Propensity prediction

# [Project 4: Energy consumption prediction web app](https://share.streamlit.io/phunbie/my_streamli_prog/main.py)
![alt text](streamlit-logo-primary-colormark-darktext.png)

Created this webapp using streamlit library and I also deployed it in the cloud with the help of streamlit cloud. The web app helps in the visualisation of selected data, you can compare different variables and predict energy consumption using different machine learning models, you can also select predictor variables you want to use.
* **Python libraries used:** Streamlit, Pandas, sklearn, Numpy, Seaborn, Pillow

# [Project 5: Credit card approval prediction](https://github.com/Phunbie/credit-card-approval-prediction/blob/production/credit_approval.ipynb)

 As a Financial institution you want to offer credit card to customers but you need to be sure that high percentage of customers you offer the credit card won't default. This project helps predict customers that have a low chance of defaulting which can help in selecting customers for credit card approval.
* **Python libraries used:** Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn
* **Input:** Customer's information
* **Output:** suitability for credit card approval

The purpose of Event Recommendation Engine Project, is to predict what events users will be interested in based on events they’ve responded to in the past, user demographic information, and what events they’ve seen and clicked on in an app.
* **Python libraries used:** os, Pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn,plotly
* **Input:** Customer's information
* **Output:** Whether a customer will be interested in an event or not.
